Start learning react  during this I made a card component and   I learned a lot of things like
knowledge about  the .jsx file, how to import and export the file from one to another, the basic 
syntax in which how its work, when we export the file , 
 Also, learn about the bable which is responsible for converting the JSX file into javascript ,
 If you want to use javascript operators use the curly braces {} and perform all the Java script 
 operation. 


Technologies:-
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
CSS: Styling for the card component
HTML: Structure of the component
